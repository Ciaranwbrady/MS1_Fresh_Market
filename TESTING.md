# Testing

## 1. Automated Testing

### Validation Testing 

Validation testing was undertaken for HTML and CSS

For HTML validation the [W3C Markup Validation](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input) was used. It yielded the following results:

With these inital results I set about fixing the returning errors. Once this was complete I retested and the following results were returned

At this stage I was happy with the HTML Validation as it returned no errors. 


For CSS validation the [W3C CSS Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) was used by direct input. It yielded the following results:

The CSS yielded no errors and I was happy to procede with further testing at this stage. 



### Lighthouse testing

For some further insight insight I tested the page with [Google Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse)

Steps taken to improve on these performance and accesibility results

-   Added title to iframe attribute 

-   Changed Navbar colour to meet accesibility guidlines and pass each test on the [Webaim Contrast Checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/)
