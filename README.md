## Purpose 

This website was designed and created to fulfill the requirements of the Milestone 1 project for the Diploma in Full Stack Development from Code Institute. In order to build this project HTML, CSS and other skills learnt from the User Centric Design module were used. 

## Aim 

The aim of this project is to create a fully responsive and aesthetically pleasing mobile first design for a local grocery store that was not prepared for Covid-19 with their online presence. Having an Instagram is not enough for a local business that wants to grow. A well designed site would help ‘The Fresh Market’ reach a wider audience and give them a chance to find more business online. The site should provide information and answers to potential new customers and existing ones. Give people the opportunity to know more about what they do and why they should support them. Another key feature would be  a space that would advertise some of the specials of the week and a section eventually for online ordering. Lastly, the user could find ways to contact and follow The Fresh Market.

## Strategy 


The aim of this project is to raise awareness of the stakeholders business with a fully responsive and visually appealing site. The site should be easy to use and build on existing mental models of mobile first design. The business will have a wide demographic so the key information should be easy to find and accessibility will be very important. 

The primary objectives of the site would be 

- Give users the chance to learn more about the business
- Show customers what is unique about The Fresh Market through text and visuals. 
- Be able to communicate what services the business offers in changing covid 19 requirements.

Meeting the user’s needs and goals

- The site should be fully responsive and have the same effectiveness on mobile and desktop.
- Imagery and icons used with short bursts of text. This will inform the user but not overwhelm and can give them the chance to learn more if they so wish.
- A single page scrolling site that will guide the user to the relevant section without confusing them by moving away from the core home page. 
- Fixed header to aid with the user’s navigation on the site for ease of use. 
- Clear indicators of social media links, contact number and google map locations if the user wishes to find the stakeholder or find out more about the business.

Following current industry best practices the site will be a one page scrolling site on desktop, with the navigation bar collapsing into a hamburger menu with a pop up modal on mobile and tablet.
