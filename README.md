## Purpose 

This website was designed and created to fulfill the requirements of the Milestone 1 project for the Diploma in Full Stack Development from Code Institute. In order to build this project HTML, CSS and other skills learnt from the User Centric Design module were used. 

## Aim 

The aim of this project is to create a fully responsive and aesthetically pleasing mobile first design for a local grocery store that was not prepared for Covid-19 with their online presence. Having an Instagram is not enough for a local business that wants to grow. A well designed site would help ‘The Fresh Market’ reach a wider audience and give them a chance to find more business online. The site should provide information and answers to potential new customers and existing ones. Give people the opportunity to know more about what they do and why they should support them. Another key feature would be  a space that would advertise some of the specials of the week and a section eventually for online ordering. Lastly, the user could find ways to contact and follow The Fresh Market.
